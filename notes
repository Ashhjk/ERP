*sap aaplications like S/4HANA ,ECC,Crm etc are created using the ABAP programming language.
*But some of the sap applications like SuccessFactors,Ariba,Concur,FieldGlass ,BTP etc are cloud SAPs..means they are not written using the ABAP..instead they are written using java , nodejs etc

*presentation layer is available to the end user
_____________APPLICATION LAYER___________
ABAP platform is the application layer
*It includes various business processses like finance ,sales etc and also custom applications everything resides here
*Advanced Business Application Programming (ABAP) is the programming language that is used to build custom applications for the application layer
**********ABAP PLATFORM FUNCTIONS************
1.act as an application run time environment
2.act as a application development environment
3.used to build custom appplications
4.used for integration and data management platform
5.security platform6.reposting platform

   ========> Application run time environment
act as the middle tier between the presentation and the databse layer
*ABAP based application are run on this platform
*it provides a secure platform
*application processing,troubleshooting and optimisation 
   ========> Application development environment
*helps to build responsive  applications using SAP UI5 for frontend and WebDinpro ABAP
   ========>Built in source management system
* custom code respository is there developed by sap...many developers can contribute to it at the same time and work on it simultaneously
*conflict resolution also ther like git 
   ========> Integration tools
*there are many integration tools  for ensuring coonrcativity btw different tools and applications 
*Remote Function Call Protocol(RFC) is one such integration tool...by using this functions can be  called in remote applications or even non sap systems
*Business Application Programming Interface(BAPI) connect between other external applications
*data integration converts the data from one form to another
