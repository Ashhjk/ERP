________ERP________

ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) is a type of software used by organizations to manage and integrate their core business processes. It provides a centralized system to collect, store, and manage data across various functions of an organization, ensuring streamlined workflows and improved efficiency.
Common Modules in ERP:

    Finance and Accounting: Tracks income, expenses, and financial reporting.
    Human Resources (HR): Manages employee data, payroll, and recruitment.
    Supply Chain Management: Oversees procurement, inventory, and logistics.
    Customer Relationship Management (CRM): Helps manage customer data and improve interactions.
    Manufacturing: Tracks production schedules and quality control.
    Sales and Marketing: Monitors sales pipelines and marketing campaigns
eg of ERP:
1.SAP
2.Microsoft
3.Infor

SAP is an erp produced by the company SAP.

________ABAP(Advanced Business Application Programming)_______
*its a high level programming language created by sap which help companies in customising the sap erp.
*Abap allows companies in customising the workflow ofvarious sap modules like financial accounting ,asset management, material management etc.
*it was developed by sap for writing sap applications 
*sap aaplications like S/4HANA ,ECC,Crm etc are created using the ABAP programming language.
*But some of the sap applications like SuccessFactors,Ariba,Concur,FieldGlass ,BTP etc are cloud SAPs..means they are not written using the ABAP..instead they are written using java , nodejs etc

____________________SAP ABAP PLATFORM FUNDAMENTALS__________________
**************different types of sap software applications****************
1.APPLICATION SOFTWARE
SAP ERP,SAP S/4 HANA : end to end application covering all the business processes
2.REPORTS AND ANALYTICS
tools that help in providing business analytics and reports
3.MOBILE ACCESS
eg: SAP FIORI they are the mobile applications so that the sap applications can be accessed anywhere
4.DBMS
eg:SAP HANA saps 
primary dbms is sap hana
5.CLOUD SOLUTIONS
Delivery of SAP solutions over the cloud, eliminating the need for on-premises infrastructure.
Includes SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP), SAP HANA Cloud, and SAP SuccessFactors.

*****SAP S/4HANA is next gen erp of sap...it allows the flow of information between various business f
unctions

******************HISTORY OF SAP's ERP***************
R2-> R3(business suite or ECC)-> Business Bydesign ->S/4 HANA

_____________SAP's 3 TIERED ARCHITECTURE______________
consist of three layers
1.presentation layer(web browser-sap fiori,business client,sap GUI)
2.Application layer
3.database layer (ABAP- SAP HANA database)

*Application and database layers can run on same hosts but possible only in case of smaller businesses ...for larger businesses both run on different hosts
     **********Database layer*********
SAP HANA database is used...while installing and running the sap application databases are created by default
*Application layer consist of numerous objects and logics
*presentation layer is available to the end user
_____________APPLICATION LAYER___________
ABAP platform is the application layer
*It includes various business processses like finance ,sales etc and also custom applications everything resides here
*Advanced Business Application Programming (ABAP) is the programming language that is used to build custom applications for the application layer
**********ABAP PLATFORM FUNCTIONS************
1.act as an application run time environment
2.act as a application development environment
3.used to build custom appplications
4.used for integration and data management platform
5.security platform
6.reporting platform

   ========> Application run time environment
act as the middle tier between the presentation and the databse layer
*ABAP based application are run on this platform
*it provides a secure platform
*application processing,troubleshooting and optimisation 

   ========> Application development environment
*helps to build responsive  applications using SAP UI5 for frontend and WebDinpro ABAP

   ========>Built in source management system
* custom code respository is there developed by sap...many developers can contribute to it at the same time and work on it simultaneously
*conflict resolution also ther like git 

   ========> Integration tools
*there are many integration tools  for ensuring coonrcativity btw different tools and applications 
*Remote Function Call Protocol(RFC) is one such integration tool...by using this functions can be  called in remote applications or even non sap systems
*Business Application Programming Interface(BAPI) connect between other external applications
*data integration converts the data from one form to another

   ========>Application security
using authentication to protect the application
   =========>Reports
get reports and analyses very easily
*ABAP LIST VIEWER(ALV) is one tool for creating aesthetic reports  in that we can sort and filter
*SAP crystal reports also a  tool supports advanced features like charting and advanced formulas

For each sap system there is a unique system id called SID.
Its alphanumeric
Start with uppercase
Only 3 letters

___________________SAP INSTANCE________________
we can think it as a work unit inside the sap system..they are doing specific jobs and services
*each sap instance run on a host..
*many instances can be run on the same host provided each of the instnaces should have unique SID and also a 2 digit instance number to uniquely identify the instance.
Types of Instances:

    Primary Application Server (PAS): The first instance created during installation. Itâ€™s the main worker for running the SAP system.
    Additional Application Server (AAS): Extra instances added to share the workload and handle more users or tasks.
    ABAP Central Services Instance (ASCS): A special instance that handles centralized services like communication and synchronization between other instances.

*Application layer consist of so many application instances and one instace for central services.
*the primary appllication server or instance is used at the time of installation
*every instance has a DISPATCHER
*each instance can be mapped to particular id
*dispatcher manages the processes and ensures workload is evenly distributed
*dispatcher checks the health of the processes and start or stop a process if necessaaary

______________WORK PROCESSES OF A DISPATCHER_________________
1. Dialog work process
whenever the user makes a request for some resources the dialog work process does this
*it executes the request ,get the data from the db and give it to the user
*manages the allocation of resources like memory and cpu so that multiple requests can be handled simultaneously

2.Batch work process
to perform background tasks 
*report generation
*non interactive process not interating with the users
*executes long running tasks
*helps in job scheduling so that the users can set to run the most important tasks first

3.Spool work process
*its used for printing
*when someone generates the spool request the request is stored in the database and then generate the output request for print devices

4. Update work process
*it manages an update queue
*when an sap process is completed it is the update request that updates the db

there are many application server instances in the application layer also there are centrak services etc

________________ABAP APPLICATION PROCESSING STEPS___________________

1. when a user logs on to the SAP system they the SAP GUI (user interface ) puts a request into the message server in the application layer.
2. then it looks for the application server with the most available resources.
3. on finding the  available application server the message server sends the message to the GUI to connect to the dispatcher of that particular server
4.then the connection from the message server is terminated and now connected to the application server
5.authentication request including the users credentials is passed to the AS
6. users request is put in wait queue
7. its managed in first in first out basis
8. when its right time the request is given to dialog work process of dispatcher because the users request is an interactive process
eg:suppose a user want to log in to the sap system then the task handler in the dispatcher sends checks the application program buffer for the data
and then load the data from the database and bring it to the dialog work process and store it in the memory
*if the user is login for the first time then his credentials wont be in the buffer...so they task handler looks for the data in the database and fulfills the request
